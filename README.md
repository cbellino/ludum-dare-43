Wenk! Is a really short game (1 minute if you know what you are doing) about a penguin exploring a dungeon and rethinking his life choices while sacrificing things he needs to survive.

And here you might think, but what is this "wenk" i just read about, and here is your [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/23yan5/how_do_you_spell_the_noise_that_gunter_makes/).

Colin: This is the first time I "finished" a game in 3 days, so there's that. Also, wenk!

Romain: First jam ever x first time on Unity = So much FUN ! For a first time it was a good exercice, learning C# and making bad code :p Long Live Gunter !
